# Gather data {#sec-gather-data}

**Required material**

- Read *Turning History into Data: Data Collection, Measurement, and Inference in HPE*, [@cirone]
  - *Discusses some of the challenges of creating datasets.*
- Read *Two Regimes of Prison Data Collection*, [@Johnson2021Two]

**Key concepts and skills**

- Sometimes data are available, but they are not necessarily put together for the purposes of being a dataset. We have to go and gather such data. 
- It can be cumbersome and annoying to have to clean and prepare the datasets that come from these unstructured sources, however, the resulting structured, tidy, data are often especially exciting and useful.
- We can gather data from a variety of sources, including APIs, both directly, including dealing with semi-structured data, and indirectly through R Packages. We can also gather data through web scraping, although it is important to consider reasonable use and ethical concerns. Finally, we may wish to gather data from PDFs, possibly even needing to OCR them.

## Introduction

In this chapter we consider data that we must gather ourselves. This means that although the observations exist, we have to parse, pull, clean, and prepare them into the dataset that we will consider. In contrast to farmed data, discussed in  @sec-farm-data, typically, these felicitous observations are not being made available for us for the purpose of analysis. This means we need to be especially concerned with documentation, inclusion and exclusion decisions, missing data, and ethical behavior. 

As a preeminent example of such a gathered dataset, consider @Cummins2022 who use individual-level probate records from England between 1892 and 1992 to create a dataset that they then use to estimate how much wealth was being hidden. They find that about a third of the inheritance of "elites" is concealed. Wills are clearly not created for the purpose of being included in a dataset, but with a respectful approach they enable insights that we could not get by other means.

Decisions need to be made at the start of a project about the values we want the project to have. For instance, @huggingfaceethics value transparency, reproducibility, fairness, being self-critical, and giving credit. How might that affect the project? Valuing "giving credit" might mean being especially zealous about considering attribution and licensing. And being "self-critical" might mean going out of one's way to not make more of results than is appropriate.

The results of a data science workflow will never be better than their data [@bailey2008design]. And even the best statistical analysis will struggle to adjust for poorly gathered data. This means when working in a team, it is important that data gathering is conducted and overseen by the senior members of the team. And when working by oneself, it is important to give special consideration and care to this stage.

In this chapter we go through a variety of approaches for gathering data. We begin with the use of APIs and semi-structured data, such as JSON and XML. These are situations in which data providers typically specify the conditions under they are comfortable providing access. An API allows us to write code to gather data. Making data available in this way is a critical aspect of technology firms. It is especially valuable because it can be efficient and scales well.

We then turn to web scraping, which we may want to use when there are data available on a website. As these data have typically not been put together for the purposes of being a dataset, it is especially important to have deliberate and definite values for the project. Scraping is a critical part of data gathering because there are many data sources where the priorities of the data provider mean they have not implemented an API. For instance, considerable use of web scraping was critical for creating COVID-19 dashboards in the early days of the pandemic [@scrapecoviddata]. 

Finally, we consider gathering data from PDFs. While less common than needing to gather data from APIs or scraping, gathering data from PDFs opens up critical datasets, especially those contained in government reports and old books.

Gathering data requires more of us than using farmed data, but it allows us to explore especially exciting datasets and answer questions that we could not otherwise. Some of the most exciting work in the world uses gathered data, but it is especially important that we approach it with respect.


## APIs

In everyday language, and for our purposes, an Application Programming Interface (API) is a situation in which someone has set up specific files on their computer such that we can follow their instructions to get them. For instance, when we use a gif on Slack, Slack asks Giphy's server for the appropriate gif, Giphy's server gives that gif to Slack and then Slack inserts it into chat. The way in which Slack and Giphy interact is determined by Giphy's API. More strictly, an API is just an application that runs on a server that we access using the HTTP protocol. 

Here we focus on using APIs for gathering data. In that context an API is a website that is set-up for another computer to be able to access, rather than a person. For instance, we could go to [Google Maps](https://www.google.com/maps). And we could then scroll and click and drag to center the map on, say, Canberra, Australia. Or we could paste [this link](https://www.google.com/maps/@-35.2812958,149.1248113,16z) into the browser. By pasting that link, rather than navigating, we have mimicked how we will use an API: provide it with a URL and be given something back. In this case the result should be a map similar to @fig-focuson2020.

![Example of Google Maps, as at 29 January 2022](figures/googlemaps.png){#fig-focuson2020 width=90% fig-align="center"}

The advantage of using an API is that the data provider specifies exactly the data that they are willing to provide, and the terms under which they will provide it. These terms may include aspects such as rate limits (i.e. how often we can ask for data), and what we can do with the data, for instance, we might not be allowed to use it for commercial purposes, or to republish it. Additionally, because the API is being provided specifically for us to use it, it is less likely to be subject to unexpected changes or legal issues. Because of this it is clear that when an API is available, we should try to use it rather than web scraping.

We will now go through a few case studies of using APIs. In the first we deal directly with an API using `httr` [@citehttr]. In the second we access data from Twitter using `rtweet` [@rtweet]. And in the third we access data from Spotify using `spotifyr` [@spotifyr]. Developing comfort with gathering data through APIs enables access to exciting datasets. For instance, @facebookapitrump use the Facebook Political Ad API to gather all 218,100 of the Trump 2020 campaign ads to better understand the campaign. 


### Gathering data from arXiv, NASA, and Dataverse

We use `GET()` from `httr` [@citehttr] to obtain data from an API directly. This will try to get some specific data and the main argument is "url". In a way, this is similar to the earlier Google Maps example. In that example, the specific information that we were interested in was a map. 

In this case study we will use an [API provided by arXiv](https://arxiv.org/help/api/). arXiv is an online repository for academic papers before they go through peer-review, and these are typically referred to as "pre-prints". After installing and loading `httr`, we use `GET()` to ask arXiv to obtain some information about the pre-print of @Alexander2020. 

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false

library(httr)
library(tidyverse)
library(xml2)

arxiv <-
  GET("http://export.arxiv.org/api/query?id_list=2111.09299")

status_code(arxiv)
```

We can use `status_code()` to check whether we received an error from the server. And assuming we received something back from the server, we can use `content()` to display the information. In this case we have received XML formatted data. XML is a markup language where entries are identified by tags, which can be nested within other tags. We can read XML using `read_xml()` from `xml2` [@xml2]. XML is a semi-formatted structure, and it can be useful to start by having a look at it using `html_structure()`.

```{r}
content(arxiv) |>
  read_xml() |>
  html_structure()
```

We might be interested to create a dataset based on extracting various aspects of this XML tree. For instance, we might look at "entry", which is the eighth item, and in particular obtain the "title" and the "URL", which are the fourth and ninth items, respectively, within "entry". 

```{r}
data_from_arxiv <-
  tibble(
    title = content(arxiv) |>
      read_xml() |>
      xml_child(search = 8) |>
      xml_child(search = 4) |>
      xml_text(),
    link = content(arxiv) |>
      read_xml() |>
      xml_child(search = 8) |>
      xml_child(search = 9) |>
      xml_attr("href")
  )
data_from_arxiv
```

To consider another example, each day NASA provides the Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD) through its [APOD API](https://api.nasa.gov). We can again use `GET()` to obtain the URL for the photo on particular dates and then display it. 

::: {.content-visible when-format="pdf"}
```{r}
common_url_part <- 
  "https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod?api_key=DEMO_KEY&date="

NASA_APOD_20211226 <-
  GET(paste0(common_url_part, "2021-12-26"))

NASA_APOD_20190719 <-
  GET(paste0(common_url_part, "2019-07-19"))
```
:::

::: {.content-visible unless-format="pdf"}
```{r}
NASA_APOD_20190719 <-
  GET("https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod?api_key=DEMO_KEY&date=2021-12-26")

NASA_APOD_20190719 <-
  GET("https://api.nasa.gov/planetary/apod?api_key=DEMO_KEY&date=2019-07-19")
```
:::

Examining the returned data using `content()`, we can see that we are provided with various fields, such as date, title, explanation, and a URL. 

::: {.content-visible when-format="pdf"}
(Note that we truncate certain calls to fit into the page width.)

```{r}
# APOD December 26, 2021
content(NASA_APOD_20211226)$date
content(NASA_APOD_20211226)$title |> stringr::str_trunc(width = 70)
content(NASA_APOD_20211226)$explanation |> stringr::str_trunc(width = 70)
content(NASA_APOD_20211226)$url

# APOD July 19, 2019

content(NASA_APOD_20190719)$explanation |> stringr::str_trunc(width = 70)
content(NASA_APOD_20190719)$url
```
:::

::: {.content-visible unless-format="pdf"}
```{r}
# APOD December 26, 2021
content(NASA_APOD_20211226)$date
content(NASA_APOD_20211226)$title
content(NASA_APOD_20211226)$explanation
content(NASA_APOD_20211226)$url

# APOD July 19, 2019

content(NASA_APOD_20190719)$title
content(NASA_APOD_20190719)$explanation
content(NASA_APOD_20190719)$url
```

We can provide that URL to `include_graphics()` from `knitr` to display it (@fig-nasaone).

Finally, another common API response in semi-structured form is JSON. [JSON](https://www.json.org/json-en.html) is a human-readable way to store data that can be parsed by machines. In contrast to, say, a CSV, where we are used to rows and columns, JSON uses key-value pairs.

```{css}
{
  "firstName": "Rohan",
  "lastName": "Alexander",
  "age": 36,
  "favFoods": {
    "first": "Pizza",
    "second": "Bagels",
    "third": null
  }
}
```

We can parse JSON with `jsonlite` [@jsonlite]. To consider a specific example, a "Dataverse" is a web application that makes it easier to share dataset. We can use an API to query a demonstration dataverse. For instance, we might be interested in datasets related to politics.

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| eval: true
#| echo: true

library(jsonlite)

politics_datasets <-
  fromJSON("https://demo.dataverse.org/api/search?q=politics")

politics_datasets
```

We can also look at the dataset using `View(politics_datasets)`, which allows us to expand the tree based on what we are interested in. We can even get the code that we need to focus on different aspects by hovering on the item and then clicking the icon with the green arrow (@fig-jsonfirst).

![Example of hovering over an JSON element, "items", where the icon with a green arrow can be clicked on to get the code that would focus on that element](figures/jsonlite.png){#fig-jsonfirst width=90% fig-align="center"}

This tells us how to obtain the dataset of interest.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

as_tibble(politics_datasets[["data"]][["items"]])
```




### Gathering data from Twitter

Twitter is a rich source of text and other data and an extraordinary amount of academic research uses it [@twitterseemsokay] The Twitter API is the way in which Twitter asks that we gather these data. `rtweet` [@rtweet] is built around this API and allows us to interact with it in ways that are similar to using any other R package. Initially, we can use the Twitter API with just a regular Twitter account. 

Begin by installing and loading `rtweet` and `tidyverse`. We then need to authorize `rtweet` and we start that process by calling any function from the package, for instance `get_favorites()` which would normally return a tibble of a user's favorites. When it is executed before authorization, this will open a browser, and we then log into a regular Twitter account (@fig-rtweetlogin).

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| label: loadpackages

library(rtweet)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| label: initialise_rtweet

get_favorites(user = "RohanAlexander")
```

![rtweet authorisation page](figures/rtweet.png){#fig-rtweetlogin width=90% fig-align="center"}

Once the application is authorized, we can use `get_favorites()` to actually get the favorites of a user and save them.

```{r}
#| label: get_rohan_favs
#| eval: false

rohans_favorites <- get_favorites("RohanAlexander")

saveRDS(rohans_favorites, "rohans_favorites.rds")
```

```{r}
#| label: get_rohan_favsactual
#| include: false
#| eval: false

# INTERNAL

rohans_favorites <- get_favorites("RohanAlexander")

saveRDS(rohans_favorites, "inputs/data/rohans_favs.rds")
```

```{r}
#| include: false
rohans_favorites <- readRDS(here::here("inputs/data/rohans_favs.rds"))
```

We could then look at some recent favorites, keeping in mind that they may be different depending on when they are being accessed.

```{r}
#| label: look_at_rohans_favs

rohans_favorites |>
  arrange(desc(created_at)) |>
  slice(1:10) |>
  select(screen_name, text)
```

We can use `search_tweets()` to search for tweets about a particular topic. For instance, we could look at tweets using a hashtag commonly associated with R: "#rstats". 

```{r}
#| label: get_rstats
#| eval: false

rstats_tweets <- search_tweets(
  q = "#rstats",
  include_rts = FALSE
)

saveRDS(rstats_tweets, "rstats_tweets.rds")
```

```{r}
#| label: get_rstatsactual
#| include: false
#| eval: false

# INTERNAL

rstats_tweets <- search_tweets(
  q = "#rstats",
  include_rts = FALSE
)

saveRDS(rstats_tweets, "inputs/data/rstats_tweets.rds")
```

```{r}
#| include: false
rstats_tweets <- readRDS(here::here("inputs/data/rstats_tweets.rds"))
```

```{r}
#| label: look_at_rstats

rstats_tweets |>
  select(screen_name, text) |>
  head()
```

Other useful functions that can be used include `get_friends()` to get all the accounts that a user follows, and `get_timelines()` to get a user's recent tweets. Registering as a developer enables access to more Twitter API functionality. 

When using APIs, even when they are wrapped in an R package, in this case `rtweet`, it is important to read the terms under which access is provided. The Twitter API docs are surprisingly readable, and the [developer policy](https://developer.twitter.com/en/developer-terms/policy) is especially clear. To see how easy it is to violate the terms under which an API provider makes data available, consider that we saved the tweets that we downloaded. If we were to push these to GitHub, then it is possible that we may have accidentally stored sensitive information if there happened to be some in the tweets. Twitter is also explicit about asking those that use their API to be especially careful about sensitive information and not matching Twitter users with their off-Twitter identity. Again, the [documentation around these restricted uses](https://developer.twitter.com/en/developer-terms/more-on-restricted-use-cases) is clear and readable.



### Gathering data from Spotify

We use `spotifyr` [@spotifyr], which is a wrapper around the Spotify API. Install and load the package.

```{r}
#| eval: false

install.packages("spotifyr")
```


```{r}
library(spotifyr)
```

To access the Spotify API, we need a [Spotify Developer Account](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/). This will require logging in with a Spotify account and then accepting the Developer Terms (@fig-spotifyaccept).

![Spotify Developer Account Terms agreement page](figures/spotify.png){#fig-spotifyaccept width=90% fig-align="center"}

::: {.content-visible when-format="pdf"}
Continuing with the registration process; in our case, we "do not know" what we are building and so Spotify requires us to use a non-commercial agreement. To use the Spotify API we need a "Client ID" and a "Client Secret". These are things that we want to keep to ourselves because anyone with the details could use our developer account as though they were us. One way to keep these details secret with a minimum of hassle is to keep them in our "System Environment". In this way, when we push to GitHub they should not be included. (We again follow this process, but without explanation, in the ["Interactive communication" Online Appendix](https://tellingstorieswithdata.com/24-interactive_communication.html) when we use `mapdeck`.) To do this we will use `usethis` [@citeusethis] to modify our System Environment. In particular, there is a file called ".Renviron" which we will open and then add our "Client ID" and "Client Secret".

In particular, there is a file called ".Renviron" which we will open and then add our "Client ID" and "Client Secret".
:::


```{r}
#| eval: false

library(usethis)

edit_r_environ()
```

When we run `edit_r_environ()`, our ".Renviron" file will open and we can add our "Spotify Client ID" and "Client Secret". It is important to use the same names, because `spotifyr` will look in our environment for keys with those specific names. 

```{r}
#| eval: false

SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID <- "PUT_YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE"
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET <- "PUT_YOUR_SECRET_HERE"
```

Save the ".Renviron" file, and then restart R ("Session" -> "Restart R"). We can now use our "Spotify Client ID" and "Client Secret" as needed. And functions that require those details as arguments will work without them being explicitly specified again. 

To try this out we will get and save some information about Radiohead, the English rock band, using `get_artist_audio_features()`. One of the required arguments is `authorization`, but as that is set, by default, to look at the ".Renviron" file, we do not need to specify it here. 

```{r}
#| eval: false

radiohead <- get_artist_audio_features("radiohead")
saveRDS(radiohead, "radiohead.rds")
```

```{r}
#| include: false
#| eval: false

# INTERNAL

radiohead <- get_artist_audio_features("radiohead")
saveRDS(radiohead, "inputs/data/radiohead.rds")
```

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| include: false

radiohead <- readRDS("inputs/data/radiohead.rds")
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| include: true

radiohead <- readRDS("radiohead.rds")
```

There is a variety of information available based on songs. We might be interested to see whether their songs are getting longer over time (@fig-readioovertime). And following the guidance in @sec-static-communication this might be a nice opportunity to additionally use a boxplot to communicate summary statistics, by album at the same time.

```{r}
radiohead <- as_tibble(radiohead)

radiohead |>
  select(artist_name, track_name, album_name)
```

```{r}
#| fig-cap: "Length of each Radiohead song, over time, as gathered from Spotify"
#| label: fig-readioovertime
#| message: false
#| warning: false

library(lubridate)

radiohead |>
  mutate(album_release_date = ymd(album_release_date)) |>
  ggplot(aes(
    x = album_release_date,
    y = duration_ms,
    group = album_release_date
  )) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  geom_jitter(alpha = 0.5, width = 0.3, height = 0) +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(
    x = "Album release date",
    y = "Duration of song (ms)"
  )
```

One interesting variable provided by Spotify about each song is "valence". The Spotify [documentation](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/#/operations/get-audio-features) describe this as a measure between 0 and 1 that signals the "the musical positiveness" of the track with higher values being more positive. We might be interested to compare valence over time between a few artists, for instance, Radiohead, The National who are an American rock band, and the American singer Taylor Swift.

First, we need to gather the data.

```{r}
#| eval: false

taylor_swift <- get_artist_audio_features("taylor swift")
the_national <- get_artist_audio_features("the national")

saveRDS(taylor_swift, "taylor_swift.rds")
saveRDS(the_national, "the_national.rds")
```


```{r}
#| include: false
#| eval: false

# INTERNAL

taylor_swift <- get_artist_audio_features("taylor swift")
the_national <- get_artist_audio_features("the national")

saveRDS(taylor_swift, "inputs/data/taylor_swift.rds")
saveRDS(the_national, "inputs/data/the_national.rds")
```

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| include: false

# INTERNAL

taylor_swift <- readRDS("inputs/data/taylor_swift.rds")
the_national <- readRDS("inputs/data/the_national.rds")
```


Then we can bring them together and make the graph (@fig-swiftyvsnationalvsradiohead). This appears to show that while Taylor Swift and Radiohead have largely maintained their level of valence over time, The National has decreased theirs.

```{r}
#| fig-cap: "Comparing valence, over time, for Radiohead, Taylor Swift, and The National"
#| label: fig-swiftyvsnationalvsradiohead
#| message: false
#| warning: false

three_artists <-
  rbind(taylor_swift, the_national, radiohead) |>
  select(artist_name, album_release_date, valence) |>
  mutate(album_release_date = ymd(album_release_date))

three_artists |>
  ggplot(aes(
    x = album_release_date,
    y = valence,
    color = artist_name
  )) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.3) +
  geom_smooth() +
  theme_minimal() +
  facet_wrap(
    vars(artist_name),
    dir = "v"
  ) +
  labs(
    x = "Album release date",
    y = "Valence",
    color = "Artist"
  ) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1")
```

How amazing that we live in a world that all that information is available with very little effort or cost! And having gathered the data, there is a lot that could be done. For instance, @kaylinpavlik uses an expanded dataset to classify musical genres and @theeconomistonspotify looks at how language is associated with music streaming on Spotify. Our ability to gather such data enables us to answer questions that had to be considered experimentally in the past. For instance @salganik2006experimental had to use experimental data to analyse the social aspect of what makes a hit song, rather than the real data we are able to access. But at the same time, it is worth thinking about what valence is purporting to measure. Little information is available in the Spotify documentation about how this is being created. And it is doubtful that one number can completely represent how positive a song is. And what about the songs from these artists that are not on Spotify, or even publicly released? This is a nice example of how measurement and sampling pervade all aspects.

## Web scraping

Web scraping is a way to get data from websites. Rather than going to a website using a browser and then saving a copy of it, we write code that does it for us. This opens a lot of data to us, but on the other hand, it is not typically data that are being made available for these purposes. This means that it is especially important to be respectful. While generally not illegal, the specifics about the legality of web scraping depend on jurisdictions and what we are doing, and so it is also important to be mindful. While our use would rarely be commercially competitive, of particular concern is the conflict between the need for our work to be reproducible with the need to respect terms of service that may disallow data republishing [@luscombe2021algorithmic]. 

Privacy trumps reproducibility. There is also a considerable difference between data being publicly available on a website and being scraped, cleaned, and prepared into a dataset which is then publicly released. For instance, @kirkegaard2016okcupid scraped publicly available OKCupid profiles and then made the resulting dataset easily available [@hackett2016researchers]. @zimmer2018addressing detail some of the important considerations that were overlooked including "minimizing harm", "informed consent", and ensuring those in the dataset maintain "privacy and confidentiality". And more generally, while it is correct to say that OKCupid made data public, they did so in a certain context, and when their data was scraped that context was changed.

That all said, web scraping is an invaluable source of data. But they are typically datasets that can be created as a by-product of someone trying to achieve another aim. And web scraping imposes a cost on the website host, and so it is important to reduce this to the extent possible. For instance, a retailer may have a website with their products and their prices. That has not been created deliberately as a source of data, but we can scrape it to create a dataset. The following principles are useful to guide web scraping.

1. Avoid it. Try to use an API wherever possible.
2. Abide by their desires. Some websites have a "robots.txt" file that contains information about what they are comfortable with scrapers doing, for instance [Google's](https://www.google.com/robots.txt). 
3. Reduce the impact. 
    - Firstly, slow down the scraper, for instance, rather than having it visit the website every second, slow it down using `sys.sleep()`. If we only need a few hundred files, then why not just have it visit the website a few times a minute, running in the background overnight?
   - Secondly, consider the timing of when we run our scraper. For instance, if we are scraping a retailer then maybe we should set our script to run from 10pm through to the morning, when fewer customers are likely using the site. Similarly, if it is a government website and they have a big monthly release, then it might be polite to avoid that day.
4. Take only what is needed. For instance, we do not need to scrape the entire of Wikipedia if all we need is the names of the ten largest cities in Croatia. This reduces the impact on the website, and allows us to more easily justify our actions.
5. Only scrape once. This means we should save everything as we go so that we do not have to re-collect data. Similarly, once we have the data, we should keep that separate and not modify it. If we need data over time then we will need to go back, but this is different to needlessly re-scraping a page.
6. Do not republish the pages that were scraped (this contrasts with datasets that we create from it).
7. Take ownership and ask permission if possible. At a minimum level all scripts should have our contact details in them. Depending on the circumstances, it may be worthwhile asking for permission before you scrape.

Web scraping is possible by taking advantage of the underlying structure of a webpage. We use patterns in the HTML/CSS to get the data that we want. To look at the underlying HTML/CSS we can either: 

1) open a browser, right-click, and choose something like "Inspect"; or 
2) save the website and then open it with a text editor rather than a browser.

HTML/CSS is a markup language comprised of matching tags. If we want text to be bold, then we would use something like:

```{css}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

<b>My bold text</b>
```

Similarly, if we want a list, then we start and end the list as well as indicating each item. 

```{css}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

<ul>
  <li>Learn webscraping</li>
  <li>Do data science</li>
  <li>Profit</li>
</ul>
```

When scraping we will search for these tags.

To get started, we can pretend that we obtained some HTML from a website, and that we want to get the name from it. We can see that the name is in bold, so we want to focus on that feature and extract it.

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true

website_extract <- "<p>Hi, I’m <b>Rohan</b> Alexander.</p>"
```

We will use `read_html()` from `rvest` [@citervest] to read in the data. 

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
#| warning: false
#| message: false

library(rvest)

rohans_data <- read_html(website_extract)

rohans_data
```

The language used by `rvest` to look for tags is "node", so we focus on bold nodes. By default `html_nodes()` returns the tags as well. We can focus on the text that they contain, with `html_text()`.

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true

rohans_data |>
  html_nodes("b")

first_name <-
  rohans_data |>
  html_nodes("b") |>
  html_text()

first_name
```

If you end up doing a lot of web scraping, then `polite` [@polite] may be helpful to better optimize your workflow.

### Book information

In this case study we will scrape a list of books available [here](https://rohansbooks.com). We will then clean the data and look at the distribution of the first letters of author surnames. It is slightly more complicated than the example above, but the underlying approach is the same: download the website, look for the nodes of interest, extract the information, clean it.

We use `rvest` [@citervest] to download a website, and to then navigate the HTML to find the aspects that we are interested in. And we use `tidyverse` to clean the dataset. We first need to go to the website and then save a local copy.

```{r}
#| include: false
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

# INTERNAL

library(rvest)
library(tidyverse)
library(xml2)

books_data <- read_html("https://rohansbooks.com")

write_html(books_data, "inputs/my_website/raw_data.html")
```

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
#| include: true

library(rvest)
library(tidyverse)
library(xml2)

books_data <- read_html("https://rohansbooks.com")

write_html(books_data, "raw_data.html")
```

Now we need to navigate the HTML to get the aspects that we want. And then put them into some sensible structure. We will start with trying to get the data into a tibble as quickly as possible because this will allow us to more easily use `dplyr` verbs and `tidyverse` functions.

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
#| include: true
#| message: false
#| warning: false

books_data <- read_html("inputs/my_website/raw_data.html")
```

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| include: true
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| echo: true

books_data
```

To get the data into a tibble we first need to use HTML tags to identify the data that we are interested in. If we look at the website then we need to focus on list items (@fig-rohansbooks-display). And we can look at the source, focusing particularly on looking for a list (@fig-rohansbooks-html).

::: {#fig-rohansbooks layout-ncol=2}

![Books website as displayed](figures/books_display.png){#fig-rohansbooks-display width=50%}

![HTML for the top of the books website and the list of books](figures/books_source.png){#fig-rohansbooks-html width=50%}

Screen captures from the books website as at 16 June 2022
:::


The tag for a list item is "li", so we can use that to focus on the list.

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| include: true
#| echo: true

text_data <-
  books_data |>
  html_nodes("li") |>
  html_text()

all_books <-
  tibble(books = text_data)

head(all_books)
```

We now need to clean the data. First we want to separate the title and the author using `separate()` and then clean up the author and title columns. We can take advantage of the fact that the year is present and separate based on that.

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| include: true
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| echo: true

all_books <-
  all_books |>
  mutate(books = str_squish(books)) |>
  separate(books, 
           into = c("author", "title"), 
           sep = "\\, [[:digit:]]{4}\\, "
           )

all_books
```

Finally, we could make, say, a table of the distribution of the first letter of the names (@tbl-lettersofbooks).

```{r}
#| label: tbl-lettersofbooks
#| eval: true
#| echo: true
#| tbl-cap: "Distribution of first letter of author names in a collection of books"

all_books |>
  mutate(
    first_letter = str_sub(author, 1, 1)
  ) |>
  group_by(first_letter) |>
  count() |>
  knitr::kable(
    col.names = c("First letter", "Number of times"),
    booktabs = TRUE,
    linesep = ""
  )
```



### UK Prime Ministers from Wikipedia

In this case study we are interested in how long UK prime ministers lived, based on the year that they were born. We will scrape data from Wikipedia using `rvest` [@citervest], clean it, and then make a graph. Every time we scrape a website things will change. Each scrape will largely be bespoke, even if we can borrow some code from earlier projects. It is completely normal to feel frustrated at times. It helps to begin with an end in mind. 

To that end, we can start by generating some simulated data. Ideally, we want a table that has a row for each prime minister, a column for their name, and a column each for the birth and death years. If they are still alive, then that death year can be empty. We know that birth and death years should be somewhere between 1700 and 1990, and that death year should be larger than birth year. Finally, we also know that the years should be integers, and the names should be characters. We want something that looks roughly like this:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| message: false
#| warning: false

library(babynames)

set.seed(853)

simulated_dataset <-
  tibble(
    prime_minister = sample(
      x = babynames |> filter(prop > 0.01) |>
        select(name) |> unique() |> unlist(),
      size = 10,
      replace = FALSE
    ),
    birth_year = sample(
      x = c(1700:1990),
      size = 10,
      replace = TRUE
    ),
    years_lived = sample(
      x = c(50:100),
      size = 10,
      replace = TRUE
    ),
    death_year = birth_year + years_lived
  ) |>
  select(prime_minister, birth_year, death_year, years_lived) |>
  arrange(birth_year)

simulated_dataset
```

One of the advantages of generating a simulated dataset is that if we are working in groups then one person can start making the graph, using the simulated dataset, while the other person gathers the data. In terms of a graph, we are aiming for something like @fig-pmsgraphexample.

![Sketch of planned graph showing how long UK prime ministers lived](figures/pms_graph_plan.png){#fig-pmsgraphexample width=95% fig-align="center"}

We are starting with a question that is of interest, which how long each UK prime minister lived. As such, we need to identify a source of data. While there are plenty of data sources that have the births and deaths of each prime minister, we want one that we can trust, and as we are going to be scraping, we want one that has some structure to it. The [Wikipedia page about UK prime ministers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_prime_ministers_of_the_United_Kingdom) fits both these criteria. As it is a popular page the information is likely to be correct, and the data are available in a table.

We load `rvest` and then download the page using `read_html()`. Saving it locally provides us with a copy that we need for reproducibility in case the website changes, and means that we do not have to keep visiting the website. But it is not ours, and so this is typically not something that should be necessarily redistributed.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| message: false
#| warning: false

library(rvest)
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
#| include: false

# INTERNAL

raw_data <-
  read_html(
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_prime_ministers_of_the_United_Kingdom"
  )
write_html(raw_data, "inputs/wiki/pms.html") # Note that we save the file as a HTML file.
```

::: {.content-visible when-format="pdf"}
```{r} 
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
#| include: true

raw_data <-
  read_html(
    paste0("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/",
    "List_of_prime_ministers_of_the_United_Kingdom")
  )
write_html(raw_data, "pms.html")
```
:::

::: {.content-visible unless-format="pdf"}
```{r} 
#| echo: true
#| eval: false
#| include: true

raw_data <-
  read_html(
    "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_prime_ministers_of_the_United_Kingdom"
  )
write_html(raw_data, "pms.html")
```
:::

As with the earlier case study, we are looking for patterns in the HTML that we can use to help us get closer to the data that we want. This is an iterative process and requires a lot of trial and error. Even simple examples will take time. 

One tool that may help is the [SelectorGadget](https://rvest.tidyverse.org/articles/articles/selectorgadget.html). This allows us to pick and choose the elements that we want, and then gives us the input for `html_nodes()` (@fig-selectorgadget).

![Using the Selector Gadget to identify the tag, as at 13 March 2022.](figures/uk_pms.png){#fig-selectorgadget width=75% fig-align="center"}


```{r}
#| eval: false
#| include: true

# Read in our saved data
raw_data <- read_html("pms.html")
```

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| include: false

raw_data <- read_html("inputs/wiki/pms.html")

raw_data
```

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| include: true

# We can parse tags in order
parse_data_selector_gadget <-
  raw_data |>
  html_nodes("td:nth-child(3)") |>
  html_text()

head(parse_data_selector_gadget)
```

In this case there are a few blank lines that we will need to filter away.

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| include: true

parsed_data <-
  tibble(raw_text = parse_data_selector_gadget) |>
  filter(raw_text != "—\n") |>
  filter(
    !raw_text %in% c(
      "\n1868\n",
      "\n1874\n",
      "\n1880\n",
      "\n1885\n",
      "\n1892\n",
      "\n1979\n",
      "\n1997\n",
      "\n2010\n"
    )
  ) |>
  filter(
    !raw_text %in% c(
      "\nNational Labour\n",
      "\nWilliam Pulteney1st Earl of Bath(1684–1764)\n",
      "\nJames Waldegrave2nd Earl Waldegrave(1715–1763)\n",
      "\nEdward VII\n\n\n1901–1910\n\n",
      "\nGeorge V\n\n\n1910–1936\n\n"
    )
  )

head(parsed_data)
```

Now that we have the parsed data, we need to clean it to match what we wanted. In particular we want a names column, as well as columns for birth year and death year. We use `separate()` to take advantage of the fact that it looks like the dates are distinguished by brackets.

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| include: true

initial_clean <-
  parsed_data |>
  mutate(raw_text = str_remove_all(raw_text, "\n")) |>
  separate(
    raw_text,
    into = c("Name", "not_name"),
    sep = "\\(",
    remove = FALSE
  ) |> # The remove = FALSE option here means that we
  # keep the original column that we are separating.
  separate(
    not_name,
    into = c("Date", "all_the_rest"),
    sep = "\\)",
    remove = FALSE
  )

head(initial_clean)
```

Finally, we need to clean up the columns.

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| include: true

initial_clean <-
  initial_clean |>
  separate(
    col = Name,
    into = c("Name", "Title"),
    sep = "[[:digit:]]",
    extra = "merge",
    fill = "right"
  ) |>
  separate(
    col = Name,
    into = c("Name", "Title"),
    sep = "MP for",
    extra = "merge",
    fill = "right"
  ) |>
  mutate(Name = str_remove(Name, "\\[b\\]"))

head(initial_clean)
```


```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false

cleaned_data <-
  initial_clean |>
  select(Name, Date) |>
  # The PMs who have died have their birth and death years 
  # separated by a hyphen, but we need to be careful with 
  # the hyphen as it seems to be a slightly odd type of 
  # hyphen and we need to copy/paste it.
  separate(Date, into = c("Birth", "Died"), 
           sep = "–", 
           remove = FALSE) |> 
  mutate(
    Birth = str_remove_all(Birth, "born"),
    Birth = str_trim(Birth)
  ) |> # Alive PMs have slightly different format
  select(-Date) |>
  # Remove some HTML tags that remain
  mutate(Name = str_remove(Name, "\n")) |> 
  # Change birth and death to integers
  mutate_at(vars(Birth, Died), ~ as.integer(.)) |> 
  # Add column of the number of years they lived
  mutate(Age_at_Death = Died - Birth) |> 
  # Some of the PMs had two goes at it.
  distinct() 

head(cleaned_data)
```

Our dataset looks similar to the one that we said we wanted at the start (@tbl-canadianpmscleanddata).

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: true
#| label: tbl-canadianpmscleanddata
#| tbl-cap: "UK Prime Ministers, by how old they were when they died"

cleaned_data |>
  head() |>
  knitr::kable(
    col.names = c("Prime Minister", 
                  "Birth year", 
                  "Death year", 
                  "Age at death"),
    booktabs = TRUE,
    linesep = ""
  )
```


At this point we would like to make a graph that illustrates how long each prime minister lived. If they are still alive then we would like them to run to the end, but we would like to color them differently.

```{r}
#| echo: true

cleaned_data |>
  mutate(
    still_alive = if_else(is.na(Died), "Yes", "No"),
    Died = if_else(is.na(Died), as.integer(2022), Died)
  ) |>
  mutate(Name = as_factor(Name)) |>
  ggplot(aes(
    x = Birth,
    xend = Died,
    y = Name,
    yend = Name,
    color = still_alive
  )) +
  geom_segment() +
  labs(
    x = "Year of birth",
    y = "Prime minister",
    color = "PM is currently alive",
    title = "How long each UK Prime Minister lived, by year of birth"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Set1") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```


### Downloading multiple files

Considering text as data is exciting and opens a lot of different research questions. Many guides assume that we already have a nicely formatted text dataset, but that is rarely actually the case. In this case study we will download files from a few different pages. While we have already seen two examples of web scraping, those were focused on just one page, whereas we often need many. Here we will focus on this iteration. We will use `download.file()` to do the download, and `purrr` [@citepurrr] to apply this function across multiple sites.

The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) is Australia's central bank and sets monetary policy. It has responsibility for setting the cash rate, which is the interest rate used for loans between banks. This interest rate is an especially important one and has a large impact on the other interest rates in the economy. Four times a year -- February, May, August, and November -- the RBA publishes a statement on monetary policy, and these are available as PDFs. In this example we will download the four statements published in 2021.

First we set-up a dataframe that has the information that we need.

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| message: false

library(tidyverse)

common_url_bit <- "https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/smp/2021/"

statements_of_interest <-
  tibble(
    address =
      c(
        paste0(common_url_bit, "nov/pdf/00-overview.pdf"),
        paste0(common_url_bit, "aug/pdf/00-overview.pdf"),
        paste0(common_url_bit, "may/pdf/00-overview.pdf"),
        paste0(common_url_bit, "feb/pdf/00-overview.pdf")
      ),
    local_save_name = c(
      "2021-11.pdf",
      "2021-08.pdf",
      "2021-05.pdf",
      "2021-02.pdf"
    )
  )

statements_of_interest
```

We want to apply the function `download.files()` to these four. To do this we write a function that will download the file, let us know that it was downloaded, wait a polite amount of time, and then go get the next file. 

```{r}
#| eval: false

visit_download_and_wait <-
  function(the_address_to_visit, where_to_save_it_locally) {
    download.file(
      url = the_address_to_visit,
      destfile = where_to_save_it_locally
    )

    print(paste("Done with", the_address_to_visit, "at", Sys.time()))

    Sys.sleep(sample(5:10, 1))
  }
```

We now apply that function to our tibble of URLs and save names using the funtion `walk2()`.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| include: true

walk2(
  statements_of_interest$address,
  statements_of_interest$local_save_name,
  ~ visit_download_and_wait(.x, .y)
)
```

The result is that we have downloaded these four PDFs and saved them to our computer. An alternative to writing these functions ourselves would be use `heapsofpapers` [@heapsofpapers], which includes various helpful options for downloading lists of files, especially PDF, CSV, and txt files. For instance, @collinsalexander use this to obtain thousands of PDFs and estimate the extent to which COVID-19 research was reproducible.
In the next section we will build on this to discuss getting information from these PDFs.


## PDFs

PDF files were developed in 1993 by the technology company Adobe and are useful for documents because they are meant to display in a consistent way independent of the environment that created them or the environment in which they are being viewed. A PDF viewed on an iPhone should look the same as on a Android phone, as on a Linux desktop. One feature of PDFs is that they can include a variety of objects, for instance, text, photos, figures, etc. However, this variety can limit the capacity of PDFs to be used directly as data inputs for statistical analysis. The data first needs to be extracted from the PDF.

It is often possible to copy and paste the data from the PDF. This is more likely when the PDF only contains simple text or regular tables. In particular, if the PDF has been created by an application such as Microsoft Word, or another document- or form-creation system, then often the text data can be extracted in this way because they are actually stored as text within the PDF. We begin with that case. But it is not as easy if the text has been stored as an image which is then part of the PDF. This may be the case for PDFs produced through scans or photos of physical documents, and some older document preparation software. We go through that case later.

In contrast to an API, a PDF is usually only produced for human rather than computer consumption. The nice thing about PDFs is that they are static and constant. And it is great that data are available. But the trade-off is that:

- It is not overly useful to do larger-scale statistical analysis.
- We do not know how the PDF was put together so we do not know whether we can trust it.
- We cannot manipulate the data to get results that we are interested in.

There are two important aspects to keep in mind when extracting data from a PDF:

1. Begin with an end in mind. Planning and then literally sketching out what we want from a final dataset/graph/paper stops us wasting time and keeps us focused. 
2. Start simple, then iterate. The quickest way to make a complicated model is often to first build a simple model and then complicate it. Start with just trying to get one page of the PDF working or even just one line. Then iterate from there.

We will start by walking through several examples and then go through a case study where we will gather data on US Total Fertility Rate, by state.

### Jane Eyre

@fig-firstpdfexample is a PDF that consists of just the first sentence from Emily Brontë's novel *Jane Eyre* taken from Project Gutenberg [@janeeyre]. If we assume that it was saved as "first_example.pdf", then we can use `pdftools` [@pdftools] to get the text from this one-page PDF into R.

![First sentence of Jane Eyre](inputs/pdfs/first_example.png){#fig-firstpdfexample width=75% fig-align="center"}

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| include: true

library(pdftools)
library(tidyverse)

first_example <- pdf_text("first_example.pdf")

first_example

class(first_example)
```

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false

library(pdftools)
library(tidyverse)

first_example <- pdf_text("inputs/pdfs/first_example.pdf")

first_example
```

We can see that the PDF has been correctly read in, as a character vector.

We will now try a slightly more complicated example that consists of the first few paragraphs of *Jane Eyre* (@fig-secondpdfexample). Now we have the chapter heading as well.

![First few paragraphs of Jane Eyre](inputs/pdfs/second_example.png){#fig-secondpdfexample width=90% fig-align="center"}

We use the same function as before.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

second_example <- pdftools::pdf_text("second_example.pdf")
class(second_example)
second_example
```


::: {.content-visible when-format="pdf"}
```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false

second_example <- pdftools::pdf_text("inputs/pdfs/second_example.pdf")
class(second_example)
second_example |> stringr::str_trunc(width = 70)
```
:::

::: {.content-visible unless-format="pdf"}
```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false

second_example <- pdftools::pdf_text("inputs/pdfs/second_example.pdf")
class(second_example)
second_example
```
:::

Again, we have a character vector. The end of each line is signaled by "\\n", but other than that it looks pretty good. Finally, we consider the first two pages.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

third_example <- pdftools::pdf_text("third_example.pdf")
class(third_example)
third_example
```

::: {.content-visible when-format="pdf"}
```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false

third_example <- pdftools::pdf_text("inputs/pdfs/third_example.pdf")
class(third_example)
third_example |> stringr::str_trunc(width = 70)

:::

Notice that the first page is the first element of the character vector, and the second page is the second element. As we are most familiar with rectangular data, we will try to get it into that format as quickly as possible. And then we can use our regular `tidyverse` functions to deal with it.

First we want to convert the character vector into a tibble. At this point we may like to add page numbers as well.

```{r}
#| echo: true

jane_eyre <- tibble(
  raw_text = third_example,
  page_number = c(1:2)
)
```

We then want to separate the lines so that each line is an observation. We can do that by looking for "\\n" remembering that we need to escape the backslash as it is a special character.

```{r}
#| echo: true

jane_eyre <-
  separate_rows(jane_eyre, raw_text, sep = "\\n", convert = FALSE)
jane_eyre
```







### US Total Fertility Rate

The US Department of Health and Human Services Vital Statistics Report provides information about the total fertility rate (the average number of births per woman if women experience the current age-specific fertility rates throughout their reproductive years) for each state for nineteen years. The US persists in only making this data available in PDFs, which hinders research. But we can use the approaches above to get the data into a nice dataset.

For instance, in the case of the year 2000 the table that we are interested in is on page 40 of a PDF that is available [here](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nvsr/nvsr50/nvsr50_05.pdf).^[If this link does not work then the PDF can be viewed [here](https://github.com/RohanAlexander/telling_stories/blob/main/inputs/pdfs/dhs/year_2000.pdf).] The column of interest is labelled: "Total fertility rate" (@fig-dhsexample). 

![Example Vital Statistics Report, from 2000](figures/dhs_example.png){#fig-dhsexample width=90% fig-align="center"}

The first step when getting data out of a PDF is to sketch out what we eventually want. A PDF typically contains a lot of information, and so it is important to be clear about what you need. This helps keep you focused, and prevents scope creep, but it is also helpful when thinking about data checks. We literally write down on paper what we have in mind. In this case, what is needed is a table with a column for state, year and total fertility rate (TFR) (@fig-tfrdesired). 

![Planned dataset of TFR for each year and US state](figures/tfr_dataset_sketch.png){#fig-tfrdesired width=40% fig-align="center"}

There are 19 different PDFs, and we are interested in a particular column in a particular table in each of them. Unfortunately, there is nothing magical about what is coming. This first step requires finding each PDF online, working out the link for each, and manually searching for the page and column name that is of interest. In the end, this looks like @tbl-dhslinks.^[To run this code use: `summary_tfr_dataset <- read_csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RohanAlexander/telling_stories/main/inputs/tfr_tables_info.csv")`.]

```{r}
#| include: true
#| echo: false
#| warning: false
#| message: false
#| label: tbl-dhslinks
#| tbl-cap: "Year and associated data for TFR tables"

summary_tfr_dataset <- read_csv("inputs/tfr_tables_info.csv")

summary_tfr_dataset |>
  select(year, page, table, column_name, url) |>
  knitr::kable(
    col.names = c("Year", "Page", "Table", "Column", "URL")
  ) |> 
  kableExtra::kable_styling(font_size = 7)
```

The first step is to get some code that works for one of them. We step through the code in a lot more detail than normal because we are going to use these pieces a lot. 

We will choose the year 2000. We first download and save the PDF using `download.file()`.

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| label: justfirstyearr
#| eval: false

download.file(
  url = summary_tfr_dataset$url[1],
  destfile = "year_2000.pdf"
)
```

```{r}
#| label: justfirstyear
#| eval: false
#| include: false

# INTERNAL

download.file(
  url = summary_tfr_dataset$url[1],
  destfile = "inputs/pdfs/dhs/year_2000.pdf"
)
```

We then read the PDF in as a character vector using `pdf_text()` from `pdftools`. And then convert it to a tibble, so that we can use familiar verbs on it.

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

library(pdftools)

dhs_2000 <- pdf_text("year_2000.pdf")
```

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false

library(pdftools)

dhs_2000 <- pdftools::pdf_text("inputs/pdfs/dhs/year_2000.pdf")
```

```{r}
#| echo: true

dhs_2000_tibble <- tibble(raw_data = dhs_2000)

head(dhs_2000_tibble)
```

Grab the page that is of interest (remembering that each page is a element of the character vector, hence a row in the tibble).

```{r}
#| echo: true

dhs_2000_relevant_page <-
  dhs_2000_tibble |>
  slice(summary_tfr_dataset$page[1])

head(dhs_2000_relevant_page)
```

Now we want to separate the rows.

```{r}
#| echo: true

dhs_2000_separate_rows <-
  dhs_2000_relevant_page |>
  separate_rows(raw_data, sep = "\\n", convert = FALSE)

head(dhs_2000_separate_rows)
```

Now we are searching for patterns that we can use. Let us look at the first ten lines of content (ignoring aspects such as headings and page numbers at the top of the page). 

```{r}
#| echo: true

dhs_2000_separate_rows[13:22, ] |>
  mutate(raw_data = str_remove(raw_data, "\\.{40}"))
```

And now at just one line.

```{r}
#| echo: true

dhs_2000_separate_rows[20, ] |>
  mutate(raw_data = str_remove(raw_data, "\\.{40}"))
```

It does not get much better than this:

1. We have dots separating the states from the data.
2. We have a space between each of the columns.

We can now separate this in to separate columns. First, we want to match on when there is at least two dots (remembering that the dot is a special character and so needs to be escaped).

```{r}
#| echo: true

dhs_2000_separate_columns <-
  dhs_2000_separate_rows |>
  separate(
    col = raw_data,
    into = c("state", "data"),
    sep = "\\.{2,}",
    remove = FALSE,
    fill = "right"
  )

dhs_2000_separate_columns[18:28, ] |>
  select(state, data)
```

<!-- We get the expected warnings about the top and the bottom as they do not have multiple dots. (Another option here is to use `pdf_data()` which would allow us to use location rather than delimiters.) -->

We can now separate the data based on spaces. There is an inconsistent number of spaces, so we first squish any example of more than one space into just one.

```{r}
#| echo: true

dhs_2000_separate_data <-
  dhs_2000_separate_columns |>
  mutate(data = str_squish(data)) |>
  separate(
    col = data,
    into = c(
      "number_of_births",
      "birth_rate",
      "fertility_rate",
      "TFR",
      "teen_births_all",
      "teen_births_15_17",
      "teen_births_18_19"
    ),
    sep = "\\s",
    remove = FALSE
  )

dhs_2000_separate_data[18:28, ] |>
  select(-raw_data, -data)
```

This is all looking fairly great. The only thing left is to clean up.

```{r}
#| echo: true

dhs_2000_cleaned <-
  dhs_2000_separate_data |>
  select(state, TFR) |>
  slice(18:71) |>
  mutate(year = 2000)

dhs_2000_cleaned
```

And we are done for that year. Now we want to take these pieces, put them into a function and then run that function over all 19 years. The first part is downloading each of the 19 PDFs that we need. We are going to build on the code that we used before, which was:

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

download.file(url = summary_tfr_dataset$url[1], 
              destfile = "year_2000.pdf"
              )
```

To modify this we need:

1. To have it iterate through each of the lines in the dataset that contains our CSVs (i.e. where it says 1, we want 1, then 2, then 3, etc.). 
2. Where it has a filename, we need it to iterate through our desired filenames (i.e. "year_2000", then "year_2001", then "year_2002", etc). 
3. We would like for it to do all of this in a way that is a little robust to errors. For instance, if one of the URLs is wrong or the internet drops out then we would like it to just move onto the next PDF, and then warn us at the end that it missed one, not to stop. (This does not really matter because it is only 19 files, but it is easy to find oneself doing this for thousands of files.)

We will `walk2()` from `purrr` for this iteration [@citepurrr]. 

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

library(purrr)

summary_tfr_dataset <-
  summary_tfr_dataset |>
  mutate(pdf_name = paste0("dhs/year_", year, ".pdf"))
```

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false

# INTERNAL

summary_tfr_dataset <-
  summary_tfr_dataset |>
  mutate(pdf_name = paste0("inputs/pdfs/dhs/year_", year, ".pdf"))
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true

library(purrr)

walk2(
  summary_tfr_dataset$url,
  summary_tfr_dataset$pdf_name,
  safely(~ download.file(.x, .y))
)
```

Here we take `download.file()` and pass it two arguments: `.x` and `.y`. Then `walk2()` applies that function to the inputs that we give it, in this case the URLs columns is the `.x` and the pdf_names column is the `.y`. Finally, `safely()` means that if there are any failures then it just moves onto the next file instead of throwing an error.

We now have each of the PDFs saved and we can move onto getting the data from them.

Now we need to get the data from the PDFs. As before, we are going to build on the code that we used before. That code (overly condensed) was:

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| eval: false

library(pdftools)

dhs_2000 <- pdf_text("year_2000.pdf")

dhs_2000 <-
  tibble(raw_data = dhs_2000) |>
  slice(summary_tfr_dataset$page[1]) |>
  separate_rows(raw_data, sep = "\\n", convert = FALSE) |>
  separate(
    col = raw_data,
    into = c("state", "data"),
    sep = "\\.{2,}",
    remove = FALSE
  ) |>
  mutate(data = str_squish(data)) |>
  separate(
    col = data,
    into = c(
      "number_of_births",
      "birth_rate",
      "fertility_rate",
      "TFR",
      "teen_births_all",
      "teen_births_15_17",
      "teen_births_18_19"
    ),
    sep = "\\s",
    remove = FALSE
  ) |>
  select(state, TFR) |>
  slice(18:71) |>
  mutate(year = 2000)
```

The first thing that we want to iterate is the argument to `pdf_text()`, then the number in `slice()` will also need to change (that is doing the work to get only the page that we are interested in).

Two aspects are hardcoded, and these may need to be updated. In particular: 

1) `separate()` only works if each of the tables has the same columns in the same order; and 
2) `slice()` (which restricts the data to just the states) only works in this one case because it references specific lines, which may differ between years. 

Finally, in the code written for the one-year, we add the year only at the end, whereas to do it for multiple years we would need to bring that up earlier in the process. 

We will start by writing a function that will go through all the files, grab the data, get the page of interest, and then expand the rows. We will then use `pmap_dfr()` from `purrr` to apply that function to all of the PDFs and to output a tibble.

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| echo: true

library(tidyverse)
library(pdftools)
library(purrr)

get_pdf_convert_to_tibble <- function(pdf_name, page, year) {
  dhs_table_of_interest <-
    tibble(raw_data = pdf_text(pdf_name)) |>
    slice(page) |>
    separate_rows(raw_data, sep = "\\n", convert = FALSE) |>
    separate(
      col = raw_data,
      into = c("state", "data"),
      sep = "[�|\\.]\\s+(?=[[:digit:]])",
      remove = FALSE
    ) |>
    mutate(
      data = str_squish(data),
      year_of_data = year
    )

  print(paste("Done with", year))

  return(dhs_table_of_interest)
}

raw_dhs_data <-
  pmap_dfr(
    summary_tfr_dataset |>
      select(pdf_name, page, year),
    get_pdf_convert_to_tibble
  )

head(raw_dhs_data)
```

Now we need to clean up the state names and then filter on them.

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| echo: true

states <- c(state.name, "District of Columbia")

raw_dhs_data <-
  raw_dhs_data |>
  mutate(
    state = str_remove_all(state, "\\."),
    state = str_remove_all(state, "�"),
    state = str_remove_all(state, "\u0008"),
    state = str_replace_all(state, "United States 1", "United States"),
    state = str_replace_all(state, "United States1", "United States"),
    state = str_replace_all(state, "United States 2", "United States"),
    state = str_replace_all(state, "United States2", "United States"),
    state = str_replace_all(state, "United States²", "United States"),
  ) |>
  mutate(state = str_squish(state)) |>
  filter(state %in% states)

head(raw_dhs_data)
```

The next step is to separate the data and get the correct column from it. We are going to separate based on spaces once it is cleaned up.

```{r}
#| message: false
#| warning: false
#| echo: true

raw_dhs_data <-
  raw_dhs_data |>
  mutate(data = str_remove_all(data, "\\*")) |>
  separate(
    data,
    into = c(
      "col_1",
      "col_2",
      "col_3",
      "col_4",
      "col_5",
      "col_6",
      "col_7",
      "col_8",
      "col_9",
      "col_10"
    ),
    sep = " ",
    remove = FALSE
  )
head(raw_dhs_data)
```

We can now grab the correct column.

```{r}
#| echo: true

tfr_data <-
  raw_dhs_data |>
  mutate(TFR = if_else(year_of_data < 2008, col_4, col_3)) |>
  select(state, year_of_data, TFR) |>
  rename(year = year_of_data)

head(tfr_data)
```


Finally, we need to convert the case.

```{r}
#| echo: true

head(tfr_data)

tfr_data <-
  tfr_data |>
  mutate(
    TFR = str_remove_all(TFR, ","),
    TFR = as.numeric(TFR)
  )

head(tfr_data)
```

And run some checks.

```{r}
#| echo: true

tfr_data$state |>
  unique() |>
  length() == 51
tfr_data$year |>
  unique() |>
  length() == 19
```

In particular we want for there to be 51 states and for there to be 19 years.

And we are done (@tbl-tfrforthewin)!

```{r}
#| label: tbl-tfrforthewin
#| echo: true
#| tbl-cap: First ten rows of a dataset of TFR by US state, 2000-2019

tfr_data |>
  slice(1:10) |>
  mutate(across(TFR, ~ format(.x, big.mark = ","))) |>
  knitr::kable(
    col.names = c("State", "Year", "TFR"),
    digits = 0,
    booktabs = TRUE,
    linesep = ""
  )
```

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| include: false

write_csv(tfr_data, "outputs/monicas_tfr.csv")
```


@kieransparsing provides another example of using this same approach in a slightly different context.



### Optical Character Recognition

All of the above is predicated on having a PDF that is already "digitized". But what if it is images, such as the result of a scan. Such PDFs often contain unstructured data, meaning that the data are not tagged nor organised in a regular way. Optical character recognition (OCR) is a process that transforms an image of text into actual text. Although there may not be much difference to a human reading a PDF before and after OCR, the PDF is now machine-readable [@Cheriet2007]. OCR has been used to parse images of characters since the 1950s, initially using manual approaches. While manual approaches remain the gold standard, for reasons of cost effectiveness, this has been largely replaced by the use of statistical models. 

In this example we use `tesseract` [@citetesseract] to OCR a document. This is a R wrapper around the Tesseract open-source OCR engine. Tesseract was initially developed at HP in the 1980s, and is now mostly developed by Google.

Let us see an example with a scan from the first page of Jane Eyre (@fig-janescan).

![Scan of first page of Jane Eyre](figures/jane_scan.png){#fig-janescan width=90% fig-align="center"}

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| include: true

library(tesseract)

text <- tesseract::ocr(
  here::here("jane_scan.png"),
  engine = tesseract("eng")
)
cat(text)
```

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false

library(tesseract)

text <- ocr(
  here::here("figures/jane_scan.png"),
  engine = tesseract("eng")
)
cat(text)
```

In general the result is not too bad. OCR is a useful tool but is not perfect and the resulting data may require extra attention in terms of cleaning. For instance, in the OCR results of @fig-janescan we see irregularities that would need to be fixed. Various options, such as focusing on the particular data of interest and increase the contrast can help. Other popular OCR engines include Amazon Textract, Google Vision API, and ABBYY.
