# Telling Stories with Data

This book will help you tell stories with data. It establishes a foundation on which you can build and share knowledge about an aspect of the world of interest to you based on data that you observe. Telling stories in small groups around a fire played a critical role in the development of humans and society (Wiessner 2014). Today our stories, based on data, can influence millions.

A print version was accepted for publication by CRC Press, and (hopefully) will be available in 2023.
