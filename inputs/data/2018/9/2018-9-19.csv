Thanks to the thrilling victory in the Canadian Little League Championship, the all-star team from Whalley earned the right to represent Canada at the Little League Baseball World Series in South Williamsport, Pennsylvania.
There, they made Surrey proud, playing hard and showing immense strength and enthusiasm on the field, despite the fact that the team faced adversity prior to the tournament. For a time, it was unclear whether one of their teammates, Dio Gama, could join them. However, with the help of the Minister of Immigration and Minister of Public Safety, he was able to go.
It was my honour to host them in my constituency office this summer. This wonderful celebration included a surprise message from our Prime Minister, which delighted the players and helped turn it into an unforgettable day for the team. A special thanks goes out to the team's parents and coaching staff, led by Mike Marino, for following and supporting their team on the road for 46 days.",Liberal,Surrey Centre,Randeep Sarai,http://www.parl.gc.ca/Parliamentarians/en/members/randeep-sarai(219988)

 Since creating PIE Education, we have supplied over 10,000 backpacks to children in need in the Barrie area. Some of our community partner organizations include the Barrie Municipal Non-Profit Housing Corporation, Simcoe County Housing Corporation, Canadian Mental Health Association, Barrie Native Friendship Centre, Women &amp; Children's Shelter of Barrie and local church groups.
 Having grown up in government housing, I understand how not having school supplies can create anxiety in students. It leads to decreased confidence and performance. Parents should never have to choose between buying their kids new shoes or school supplies.
On behalf of PIE Education, I would like to thank all of our donors, sponsors, volunteers and community partners. It is because of your generous support that over 2,200 children are prepared for success this school year.",Conservative,Barrie—Springwater—Oro-Medonte,Alex Nuttall,http://www.parl.gc.ca/Parliamentarians/en/members/alex-nuttall(234879)

Sgro (Humber River—Black Creek, Lib.)",,Statements By Members,Executive Director of Delta Family Resource Centre,,"Mr. Speaker, I rise in the House today to recognize the executive director of the Delta Family Resource Centre, Kemi Jacobs.
 Ms. Jacobs has over 20 years of community involvement and has been a leader in the non-government and public sectors in many roles. Some of those roles include the president of the Canadian Council for Refugees, executive director of CultureLink settlement services, chairperson of the National Anti-Racism Council of Canada, director of house at Toronto Community Housing, and the list goes on.
She is truly a remarkable individual. That is why it comes as no surprise that Ms. Jacobs will be included in Jean Augustine's book entitled 100 Accomplished Black Canadian Women.
 This is quite an honour for Kemi to be recognized. I would like to share in that recognition by congratulating her today on her continuous hard work and volunteerism, inside and outside of my riding Humber River—Black Creek.",Liberal,Humber River—Black Creek,Judy Sgro,http://www.parl.gc.ca/Parliamentarians/en/members/judy-sgro(220250)

She was only 14 years old, and she was loved. This nation failed her, because when she needed help, nothing was available. She died alone.
Azraya is just one of the 5,800 youth we have lost in this nation to suicide.
What country watches the death of its children and does nothing? Canada is one of the only developed countries without a national suicide prevention plan.
 This is why I am asking my colleagues from all parties to work together to establish Motion 174 for a national suicide prevention action plan. It is not just about youth. We are seeing the crisis of suicide and depression cut across all age groups and spectrums. There is so much that can be done.
 I want to special shout-out to the amazing grassroots organizations and activists on the front lines. They are looking to this Parliament to be a positive partner, and to pass Motion 174 and establish a national suicide prevention action plan.",New Democratic Party,Timmins—James Bay,Charlie Angus,http://www.parl.gc.ca/Parliamentarians/en/members/charlie-angus(217254)
